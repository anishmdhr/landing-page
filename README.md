# landing-page

This is a webpage created on the basis of reference given in the landing page chapter of CSS Foundations course.

This marks the end of my journey to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. With the completion of this lesson I am able to design generic websites.

Further modifications will be done after I learn the JS portions.
